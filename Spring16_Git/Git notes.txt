Git Commands
-------------------


git init -> to create a local repository in our working directory, after this a hidden .git 		file will be created in the working directory, where git will track all the files and 		insertion deletions in that working directory.

git status -> to check the status of local git repository
git add <file-name> -> to add any file from the working directory to git staged area
git commit -m "custom message" -> to save the file in local repository (either from staged or 				directly from working directory)

git log -> to see the commit history in the git local repository

local directory --> git staged area --> local repository (git commit)
if we want to commit without staging then -> git commit -a -m "custom message"

git diff -> to check the changes in a file (in working directory, before staging)
git diff --staged -> to check the changes in a file (after staging) 

git rm <file-name> -> to remove file form local repository
